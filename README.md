# Flag Finder Project
This project is part of a machine learning course focused on employing the Decision Tree algorithm to create a predictive model. Utilizing the information of [Flags](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/40/flags) dataset, this model is designed to classify from which continent a description of a flag comes from. Our approach involves data processing, model training using the datasets, and hyperparameter tuning. By experimenting with various values for depth and ccp_alpha, we focus on improving the model's accuracy.

## Features
- Model Training: Utilizes training and testing datasets to develop and improve the model, ensuring its performance.
- Performance Improvement: Different depths and ccp_alpha parameters are tested to optimize the model's accuracy, indentifying the most effective value for precise classification.
- Performance Evaluation: Employs accuracy as the primary metric for evaluating the model's performance.

## Setup and installation
You can see the Jupyter Notebook [here](Find%20the%20Flag.ipynb) or can install it locally using the next steps:

**Prerequisite**: This project requires Jupyter Notebook to be installed. If you do not have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can find installation instructions at the [documentation](https://jupyter.org).

To set up and show the notebook locally, follow these steps:
1. Run the following command in your terminal to clone the project repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Joel-Milla/Find_the_Flag.git
```
2. Navigate to the cloned project directory and launch Jupyter Notebook to access the .ipynb files.
3. Run cells sequentially using `Shift + Enter`.
